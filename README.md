# Neural-Network-with-one-hidden-layer-from-scratch

In this repository, we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) regressor from scratch and learn its weights using the backpropagation algorithm.
We provide two types of ANN: 
* Neural Network without any hidden layer
* Neural networks with one hidden layer
the networks can be evaluated with provided datasets with 1-D inputs and 1-D.
You can change the parameters to see the effects.
