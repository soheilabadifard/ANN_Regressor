# ANN_Regressor

In this repository we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) regressor from scratch and learn its weights by implementing the backpropagation algorithm.
we provide two types of ANN: 
* Neural Network without any hidden layer
* Neural network with one hidden layer
the networks can be evaluated with provided datasets which has 1-D inputs and 1-D.
you can change the parameters to see the effects
